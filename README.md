# TELCO CUSTOMER CHURN ANALYSIS

## Objective:
- The analysis primarily investigates factors influencing customer churn,
particularly focusing on payment methods and contract types.


## Key Insights:

- Contract Type: Customers on month-to-month contracts show a
higher tendency to churn compared to those on yearly or bi-annual
contracts. This suggests that long-term contracts may improve
customer retention.
 - PaymentMethods: A significant proportion of customers using
electronic checks are more likely to churn compared to those using
other payment methods (credit cards, bank transfers, etc.). This could
be due to convenience or trust issues associated with electronic check
payments.

### ChurnRatebyTenure:
 - Customers with shorter tenure (less than one year) are more likely
to churn, indicating the criticality of initial engagement strategies.

### Visualizations:
- The visualizations, including bar plots and line graphs, highlight the
disparity in churn rates by different contract types and payment
methods. They also show trends over customer tenure, supporting the
need for personalized retention strategies.

### Executive Summary:

#### Objective: 
- The analysis explores customer churn patterns, focusing
on various factors such as payment methods, contract types, tenure,
and demographic attributes.
- The goal is to identify which factors are
most strongly associated with higher churn rates to guide customer
retention strategies.

#### Key Insights & Findings:
- Contract Type and Churn:Customers on month-to-month
contracts exhibit the highest churn rate, with 42% of such customers
likely to churn.
- In contrast, customers on one-year and two-year contracts have
churn rates of 11% and 3%, respectively.
- Implication: Longer contract periods serve as a strong retention tool,
as customers with extended commitments are far less likely to leave.


#### Visualizations & Data Insights:
- BarCharts and Line Graphs: 
The visual representation of churn by payment method clearly shows
that customers using electronic checks churn almost three times as
much as those using more traditional or secure methods like credit
cards.
- Customertenure vs. churn rate visualizations reveal a clear declining
trend in churn as customers' tenure increases, underscoring the need
for early-stage customer loyalty programs.
- Percentage Distribution of Churn Across Factors:
- PaymentMethods: 45% churn for electronic check users, 15% for credit
card users.
- Contract Types: 42% churn for month-to-month contracts, 11% for yearly
contracts, 3% for two-year contracts.
- Tenure: 50% churn in the first year, dropping to 15% after three year
